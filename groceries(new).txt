Lobster at 8.77/lb is a STEAL!!! Yes, it was cheaper last year but considering everything, It's actually cheaper this year, accounting for inflation.
Note : This thread usually goes online at 5:00am on Wednesday. Walmart and Kim Phat usually have their flyers online on Thursday and will be updated accordingly.
Link to last week : 28th of April to 4th of MayThanks for taking the time Op! T-bone isn't too bad either. I did wish my metro would cut thickness on demand though. You can get it 1" max online. I want 2".MTLGuru wrote: â†‘

Before anyone gets excited. Most Lobster low prices are for small lobsters under 1.25 LBS.
+1 for the effort.
Real debate is Connecticut vs Maine Lobster Rolls.
