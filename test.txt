Note : This thread usually goes online at 5:00am on Wednesday. Walmart and Kim Phat usually have their flyers online on Thursday and will be updated accordingly.
Link to last week : multiple-week-14th-april-20th-april-gro ... #p35954576Thanks for the time and effort in putting this together!!

As a shopper who's been looking at weekly flyers for the last 20+ years, I have to say that the last 3 weeks of flyers for Quebec have been "meh".
Weekly loss-leaders at the grocery stores have been underwhelming; even Costco is "meh".

And the avian flu that's hitting North America is only going to drive up the costs of ALL meats.
Ugh.
